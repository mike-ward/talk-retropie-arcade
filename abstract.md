Title:

Zap, Boom! - Building a RetroPie Arcade

Abstract:

All work and no play makes for a dull developer. And what's more fun
than building an retro arcade machine? It's a great way to get started
with credit-card sized computers like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. And
besides, you know you want one.

We'll cover building the enclosure, shopping for parts, assembly and
setting up the software. It's not nearly as hard as it sounds and when
you're done, you'll have a fun multi-game arcade with all those console
classics you grew up playing.

And if you really get bitten by the arcade bug, we can talk about more
advanced MAME and full-blown PC systems.

Finally, I'll have a couple of arcades I've made so you can see how much
fun they are to play (um, err, ask questions about).

I've been programming since the late 1900's :). I started with punch
cards, moved on to Systems Programming, then Desktop Applications and
most recently Web front-ends. I'm the original author of Hyper Terminal,
the Telnet application that shipped with Windows 95 (my 15 seconds of
fame). I also run several open source projects including, VSColorOutput
(a Visual Studio extension), Desk Drive, Tweetz and Markdown Edit. All
